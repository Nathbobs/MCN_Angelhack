Electronics_5,QW,Card works fine until my Mac Pro 8-core goes to sleep. After that it seems impossible to restore USB connectivity. Sonnet claims the issue is that Apple broke/changed the USB driver since Mac OS X 10.6.  Read their FAQ before purchasing!
Electronics_5,MX,"A great monitor for the money. We had ACER monitors where I worked several years ago, so I was confident that I would get a good product and I was not at all disappointed. I needed a space saver to replace an older tube monitor for our desk computer.  The all black case looks very nice and clean on the desk. All cables were supplied...just plug and play! Picture is bright and easy to read text from many angles. So far I've only been using this monitor in the ""normal"" mode and haven't taken advantage of its 16:9 capabilties."
Electronics_5,PH,"Let me start off with the packaging.
1. It doesn't say ""Plus"" anywhere on it.
2. The information on the back isn't always correct. It says it has a mini-usb for example when it really has a micro-usb.
3. The packaging looks like something you'd get in a airport vending machine. Not very high end at all.

What is more important is the product itself.
1. It's much lighter than expected. It's a good thing for headphones, but it does make it feel unsubstantial. The diameter is about the size of a silver dollar.
2. The shiny black plastic looks like it will damage easy.
3. The logo in the middle looks like it should be a button. It isn't.
4. The front buttons are easy to access, but the volume buttons on the side are harder to feel.
5. The blue light flashes when it's powered on.
6. It stores in a very small spiral that can be like a puzzle to unravel until you get used to it.
7. Overall it is very comfortable and easy to forget you are wearing. Doesn't fall off easily.
8. USB port is covered by a little rubber flap that isn't very reassuring.

Most important is performance.
1. Bass is underwhelming. Sound is on the tiny side.
2. Connection strength is very good. Easy to walk around the house and not lose connection.
3, You can still easily hear the world around you at normal volumes.
4. Battery lasts as long as advertised and charges quickly.
5. You can still hear the trademark ""bluetooth buzz"" when the sound is low.
6. Microphone isn't very good at hearing you. Constantly had to talk louder than I would have with a phone.

Overall I feel like it is a solid product for the price. Will it win awards in... anything? Probably not, but it is still a great value. I feel it would be a five-star product at $30-35, but at $50 it's still a solid option for small, over-ear bluetooth headphones. The main downside is you can find unbranded versions of these headphones for ~$20 on Amazon, still with Prime shipping."

Electronics_5,SA,"This system is fine if you are close to it, like the computer or video games, but for entertainment center use, it's just not as great as I was hoping. Sure, certain DVD's are louder, but some I've tried just are not as loud as I'd want with this system. I'd be better off hooking it up to my old component stereo system to get the loudness I want. I admit, the subwoofer puts out good bass, but the main speakers just don't have enough loudness."
Electronics_5,CG,"As the owner of a small business, the only thing I can say is that I am not an expert on software. The software is solid and works well. I'm a professional and have used many computers in the past. I am very pleased with the price and the quality of the products. I would recommend this to anyone who has a computer. I bought these for my husband's older one. He had to use them for a few hours and they didn't work very well. He uses them for his music and the sound quality is really good. This is a great case for a DSLR. It is easy to put on, holds the camera securely, and is very durable. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a case for a DSLR. This is a great product!  I have used it for almost a month now and it works well. It was very easy to install and the cable is very durable. It has a lot of features and looks very nice. I am happy with it. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a case for a DSLR."

Electronics_5,LA,"Had it for about a week and it still works fine. If you have a larger computer (or have a computer with a larger screen) the TRS-80 should work fine. I had this for a few months, and it worked great. I used it for a couple of weeks and then it stopped working."
Electronics_5,SA,"Works perfectly. My only qualm is that it has more ports than I need, but it was the best value of the options I reviewed so the extra ports don't bother me. Who knows, maybe I'll need them in the future - and not I have them just in case."
Electronics_5,KK,"After recently ordering a new pair of headphones, I decided to purchase a pair of the Denon.

I had a pair of Denon earbuds before, and I wanted to go back and purchase them.

I was skeptical about the Denon's functionality, but after seeing a few reviews on Amazon, I decided to give it a shot.

I plugged it into my computer, and I immediately noticed that the Denon was connected to the Denon's HDMI port.

The Denon seems to be working, and I was able to enjoy the audio and videos, and the Denon's HD was a breeze to use.

The Denon's audio quality is amazing, and the Denon's HD is excellent.

I had a Denon 3D headset, and it sounded great, too.

The Denon's audio quality was very good, and the Denon's HD is great.

Electronics_5,AD,"As many of the previous reviews have stated, these are non-focusing, fixed focus binoculars. There is absolutely nothing you can physically adjust on these. They're great for long distances, but horrible for anything within 100-150 yards. We used these on a recent trip to Yellowstone and, for the most part, they worked flawlessly. I bought these for my wife, who is not very adept at using bino's, so that she wouldn't have to fiddle with anything and see exactly what she wanted without effort.......and for that they worked brilliantly! We're going to use these next year (2017) for our Alaskan cruise. Hoping they perform just as well!"

Electronics_5,NG,Stopped working after less than a year.  Don't waste your money.
Electronics_5,OR,"I have four of these and have never had any issues.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are too small to fit comfortably in a case. The case is made of plastic and the plastic part on the bottom is very soft. If you have a large laptop with a keyboard, the case will not fit.

If you are planning to use a case for a Kindle Fire or iPad, the case will be perfect.

Overall, I am very happy with my purchase.Works great, does what it is supposed to do.  Was a little more expensive but it worked great.

I would not buy this again.This is a great product.  I have used it for years and I can tell that I have had no problems.  It is sturdy, it does not have any screws, and the tip of the tip is a little hard to lift.  It also doesn't fit in the bottom of my ipad.  The tip is a bit uncomfortable but not uncomfortable.

Electronics_5,TA,Comfortable pads that fit on the outside of the ears. (not on top so it doesn't crush the ears) The mic is clear and crisp. The sound is premium. Lots of play room so it's not squeezing my head as I have ran into in the past with other headsets. GREAT product and not too expensive.
Electronics_5,PH,has a rubbery feel and and is just the right size for the ipod 5.. a gloss back color.. can be taking on and of with no problems..
Electronics_5,LA,"Amazon.com didn't ship the complete set of adapters.  I've tried several of them, but one is a pair of the same size, one is the same size, and the other is the same size.  It's a little pricey for one set, but for two sets, it is worth it.  I've tried them all, and none work well with the same adapters.

So if you want to use the adapters for any purpose, you will need to buy the adapter for your needs.  You can buy the adapter for the same price you would need for the camera and/or other device. "

Electronics_5,AD,"As others have said, they are a bit tinny, however, for my relatively simple needs, they're fine. I got them to replace an old pair of speakers for my desktop. They're even adequate for music for non-serious listeners, but the bass, as has been said, almost disappears. I also wanted something relatively small, due to limited desktop space, and these certainly are---the other speakers certainly weren't huge, but these really do give me some extra space. Lastly, as has also been said, the instructions talk about two cables, a green and a pink, which is usually for input with a microphone. However, there's only the green cable, which is fine. Plug it into the input jack, plug the normal size power cord into an outlet, and you're good to go. (The fact that it's a standard 2 prong plug, rather than a large brick like my old speakers, was a further bonus. )

4 rather than 5 because of the tinniness, but for low cost, adequate computer speakers for those who aren't really hard core audiophiles, they can't be beat. (Also, they are somewhat nicer looking than the illustration, which has also been said."
Electronics_5,UG,Does this thing charge USB ports?  Not anymore. My computer is a Lenovo Yoga 4. 0 and I had to replace a USB port with the USB one. I plugged this into a USB port on my laptop and it was working fine.

I have no complaints. I would recommend these for anyone who wants to use them with a camera and/or other device.I bought this because it has worked flawlessly for over a year, and I like it.  I also like it for those of us who are not wired.  I was able to watch some cable TV from my car with this cable.

Electronics_5,SK,A great camera. The share function is nice. It is a little noisy but not too noisy.
Electronics_5,SK,A little smaller than my vintage 13 inch simply because this screen is wide and my old one was longer from top to bottom. But it serves the purpose quite nicely for the kitchen. I use it with my blu-ray dvd player and it is awesome. The sound is tinny even though I use external speakers. Don't know if a better pair of speakers would raise this rating but for the price of the TV I son't know if it would be worth the investment. I like it very much.
Electronics_5,ZA,Works just fine. I have it running from my 4K TV to my laptop to play games on it and haven't experienced any issues.
Electronics_5,ABJ,These worked great would recommend this itemGreat Product!Very good quality.Nice little speaker! Works great
Electronics_5,EG,"Love this cable! My data throughput has definitely increased, and the cable being flat allows it to run beneath my large area rug undetected. Add the normal fast Prime delivery = this was a great purchase."
Electronics_5,SA,"This product gets the job done. The only problem is that it comes with a small screwdriver. I bought this for a friend, and he is very happy with the purchase. The only thing I wish it had been a little bit better for is the battery life. The battery life is about 8 hours, and it will charge the phone right up to the day of the trip. It will charge the phone as long as you have the phone plugged in, so if you want to charge your phone before the trip, you can charge it for about an hour."
Electronics_5,TA,This SSD was on sale for a little over $30. The drive is a solid performer. I had a lot of trouble with the drive and it took a lot of time to get it to work. I am very pleased with the performance. I would definitely buy from this company again.
Electronics_5,OR,Very nice case.  Solidly holds my iPad with ease.  My only complaint is the screen is a little hard to read.  The case is designed to be easy to take off and on with no problems.

I have not tried to use it with any other case but I guess I am not sure if it will be an issue.  I will update if I find another one.I bought this as a replacement for my old version of the iPad.

Electronics_5,UG,"First off, I recieved the parts on time, in appropriate packaging. Adding these two sticks of ram to my older Core-Duo desktop running on Win7 64bit was a no brainer.

Electronics_5,KR,Excellent........ Knivio BTD-400 Bluetooth 4.0 Adapter.  Plugged into my Windows 8 Desktop Asus computer and it quickly installed without additional software Adapter. Very easy to installed  with no problems. This unit was plug and play in both a Windows 8 PC and an Asus eeePC Net-book running Ubuntu 12.10. No extra software install was involved - just using what was already in the systems. Also I connect it to my Bose Soundlink Mini Portabler Speaker System BT bluetooth and it works great! easy install and easy to operate.

I have had it for about a month now and it still works great. It's very easy to use and works great."
Electronics_5,TA,As long as they don't lose any files from my weddings I love them. I have never lost files from a wedding so I worry when I purchase new CF cards. So far so good.

Electronics_5,TA,"I bought this for my Windows 7 Desktop PC.  I was tired of running a cord from my router in the bedroom to the living room where the PC resides.  I have a Linksys e3000 Router which is a top of the line router.  I wanted a wireless USB device which would allow me to have a full 300MB/s connection.  This one fit the bill and was reasonably priced so I went with it.  After downloading the right drivers from the web I was set to go.  Unfortunately, I could not get a connection higher than 130MB/s.  It seems this device will only work at the full 300MB/S on the 2.4GHz band (not the 5GHz band) and only at the wider channel widths.  I set my router up this way but this would still not pick up at the full 300MB/s.

This would have been bad but not a deal breaker.  But then the device would not keep a stable connection.  It would keep dropping the connection despite the fact that the router was working just fine.  Confirmed this by using my iPad, iPhone, and my Windows laptop to connect to my router every time the connection went down.  They all worked fine.

Given these problems I decided to return the device."
Electronics_5,KR,"Great for this price point.  I love the feel of the lens.  The zoom is awesome.  If you want a high quality lens, then this"
Electronics_5,ZA,"Decent quality and works great with the power button on the Trio AXS.  None of the generic 8"" covers I tried would work since the power button is on the upper edge of one side and the holders in the other covers would hit the button.  Since this one uses three clamp locations it is not an issue.

The back cover folds pinch in if you use the elastic strap to hold the cover closed, would have been five stars if that did not happen."

Instead, the labels on the screen itself said N133HSE-EA3.  The port on this particular screen is on the opposite side from the cable and the OEM screen.  The cable is too short to reach to the opposite side, and after removing the bottom cover, I discovered you can't even move the cable to the other side as the port on the motherboard is on the same side as the OEM screen.

I had a lot of trouble with the case and the cover was very flimsy. It was hard to get the cover to slip around the tablet and to secure it in place with the tablet. I ended up going with the case and the cover"

Electronics_5,LAG,"Great price, fast shipping, good quality replacement Apple style cord. I'm not sure if this will work for ""all' Apple Chargers do to a small circuit board inside transmitting specific charger information. If its circuit board and YOUR Charge doesn't match then this replacement may not work properly. You might try contacting this seller to verify if it will work for your situation. I may have gotten lucky."
Electronics_5,AD,The trick is to READ THE DIRECTIONS before you put it on.  I didn't with the first screen I tried to apply and didn't do it right. Fortunately there are 3 screens here. Read the directions and put the last two on my two cameras.  They fit very nicely and allow the touch screen to function well while protecting it.  And you can't beat the price!
Electronics_5,CG,"I purchased this to audit my office wireless network and it was well worth every penny. Using the Alfa AWUS036H I was able to decrypt our 128-bit WEP key within 45 minutes on the first attempt, and a mere 20 on the second attempt. I knew WEP was insecure, but even though the AP was set to use MAC address filtering and no broadcast SSID, I was able to collect enough information to decrypt the WEP key and authenticate to the network. Needless to say, the office wireless has since been upgraded with an access point that supports WPA-PSK2 with AES. WEP offers little to no security, and this device can help you prove that to anyone making purchasing decisions, or even to yourself if you're a skeptic.

The Alfa AWUS036H is also good to carry around if you travel a lot and need the extra power and range (hotel wireless networks typically have a high noise threshold) to get a more stable signal. I use it with a 6 ft. USB extension cable to find the best location for signal reception. This device provides better reception than wireless adapters costing several dollars more and is an indispensable tool for wireless security auditing, I highly recommend it.

NOTE: One thing that was not clear to me was what was contained in the package and this item does come with the suction cup holder, which is not a bonus item as another vendor's listing would seem to indicate."
Electronics_5,PH,"I bought this for my daughter to use with her iPad 2. She loves it!Very nice.I bought this for a friend, and she loves it.  She is very happy with it.  It is a good value, and it is going to be a great purchase for the money.  I have a few of them in the house and they are very strong.  They are very comfortable, and I like the fact that they are so small that I can carry them in my purse or carry them around the house.  I love that they are small enough to fit in a pocket, and the speaker is great for listening to music in the car.  I am very pleased with this purchase.This is the best case for my Macbook Pro. I've had it for a while now and I have no complaints at all. I have a few other cases"
Electronics_5,AD,"Sound quality is pretty decent for the price, but what this stands out for is ease of use. I have an LG 60LB6300 60-Inch TV and at the very least you can remove this from the box, sit it on the entertainment center below the TV, plug it and the sub in and that's it. With my TV I can send the audio wirelessly which worked well, but I chose the optical cable instead. Even with the optical cable the sound bar turns on and off automatically without exception. The sub syncs by itself, and Bluetooth worked great but I only used it when I first opened the box to hear the sound from this bar. One thing I noticed is it was recommended for 43"" and smaller tvs. This may be due to length, however I mounted it in the center of the TV with the included wall mount, and if centered properly it looks perfect. It is pretty loud as well, we usually have the volume between 15 and 25 out of 100.  I have the sub turned down and in a corner behind my couch (it just needs a wall outlet) and also sounds good.  The bar itself adjusts with the TV volume which displays on the TV when adjusted. Basically I never have to touch the sound bar or use it's remote (which is a good thing cause I haven't seen it in a month). One caveat with the wall mount is the optical cable plugs in on one side of the mount than has an opening for the wire to go into the wall on the other side. Because of this the optical cable has to be routed under the mount and is slightly visible."
Electronics_5,QW,"Let me say up front that I bought the 76cs almost exclusively for marine navigation. It is a great little GPS for that purpose and I'm sure it's equally good for hiking. There are a lot better choices for auto navigation but I'm totally happy with it for my purpose. I was initially quite skeptical that a handheld's small screen real estate could be useful as a chart plotter. Nonetheless, I purchased and installed the Blue Chart Americas CD and activated the Caribbean charts. After 2 weeks of constant use sailing in the Windward Islands, I'm astounded at how well it works. With the 'declutter' mode engaged, the screens show an appropriate level of detail and the display has excellent visibility in direct sun. Although the backlight is adequate for viewing in bright conditions under a boat's bimini, I found that I actually preferred to hold it out in the direct sunlight. I particularly like the ability to customize the paging sequence and the autozoom feature is handy as well. There is nothing intuitive about the interface but after I got over the learning curve, I was surprised how quickly I could get to the info I needed. Entering lat/lon waypoints is never going to be fun without a keyboard, but is certainly manageable. If you plan ahead, you can enter them on a PC and download them. A storage card slot would be nice but the entire Caribbean chart set used less than 1/4 of the available memory and on the plus side the unit really is waterproof. The battery life is about as advertised and you can really stretch it by turning it off and on as you need it because it gets a fix in about 15 seconds if you haven't moved too far."
Electronics_5,LAG,Got them for travel purpose and have them with me. works great. Nice little speaker! Works great. Great price!Works great. The sound is great.

Electronics_5,LA,"Received the product in a timely manner.  It does have to be cut to size, but once done, it did the job."
Electronics_5,CG,"Great quality. I've only had it for a few weeks now, but you can feel the quality in the carefully crafted tips. The cable is tangle-free as stated of course and the cloth jacket is of good quality. Now it's just a thing of seeing if they last longer than my last cloth jacketed aux cable purchase."
Electronics_5,MX,"The 810 is an awesome case don't get me wrong. I really like it and am glad I picked this case after doing some research. I gave it 3 stars because there were a few things wrong with the case I noticed while re-assembling my PC. First there were a few blemishes on the paint, not horrible but still noticeable. The paint itself seems like it could get damaged pretty easy. Second, a section were the PSU is mounted was bent, but it didn't hinder the installation, just a little OCD kicking in. Third, the LED light in the back doesn't work (not sure if i missed a plug or anything) so there's that. Fourth, the fan's are nosier than I expected but that's remedied with a fan controller.

All in all the case is still great and is a huge upgrade from an Antec 900. But the 810 did come with a few unexpected imperfections. Not sure if it's because I purchased my antec from newegg and the 810 from Amazon but the antec was in pristine condition even though it arrived in a beat up box. Expected the 810 to have nothing wrong since the box seemed pretty mint, but i was mistaken.

I understand stuff like this happens, but for $170 this case should have nothing wrong with it. As a side note the case is packaged in a semi-soft foam, which was partially destroyed upon opening the box.

Hopefully there is nothing else wrong with the case.

UPDATE
*just found out the LED is powered by a SATA cable. So 1 star is bumped up."
